  Scenario Outline: Successfully add ticket image to a ticket
    When hotel staff adds an image with url "<imageUrl>" to the ticket with id "<ticketId>"
    Then the number of images in the system shall be "3"
    Then the number of images for ticket with id "<ticketId>" in the system shall be "<numberOfImagesOfTicket>"
    Then the ticket with id "<ticketId>" shall have an image with url "<imageUrl>"

    Examples: 
      | imageUrl                   | ticketId | numberOfImagesOfTicket |
      | https://imageurl.com/j.jpg |        1 |                      3 |
      | http://thisimage.com/2.png |        2 |                      1 |

  Scenario Outline: Successfully add the same ticket image to a second ticket
    When hotel staff adds an image with url "<imageUrl>" to the ticket with id "<ticketId>"
    Then the number of images in the system shall be "3"
    Then the number of images for ticket with id "<ticketId>" in the system shall be "<numberOfImagesOfTicket>"
